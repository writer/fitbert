"""
Plan:

Lemmatize word with spacy
get data/lemma_lookup table, invert
find all words that share the same lemma

maybe need to open it up a bit by stemming the word,
then inverse lookup

More acurate than ^ would be to use wordnet to find "derivationally-related terms"
see https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/327
